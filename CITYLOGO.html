<h2>CITY LOGO</h2>
<p>The flag of Indianapolis was originally designed in 1963. The star in the middle of the flag strictly represents the Soliders’ and Sailors’ Monument. This monument is located in the heart of downtown Indianapolis and is the center point to all streets in the city. The monument was made and completed in 1901 and represents hoosiers who served during the American Revolutionary War.
