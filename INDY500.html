<h2>INDY 500</h2>
<p>The largest single day sporting event in the world, the Indy 500 can host up to 350,000 fans on race day. The first race took place in 1911 with 40 cars in the field. In 1911, there were around 80,000 spectators in attendance. However, in 1912, the race was changed to only have 33 drivers in the field (which is the same number that race today), as well as the purse increasing to $50,000. Over the years there have been countless sports memories, such as rookies winning the race, multi-time winners, and major crashes. In 2017, Fernando Alonso, a Formula One driver, drove in the race. He was the first F1 driver to compete in the race since 1984. The trophy, the “Borg-Warner Trophy”, stands at 5 feet 4 inches and weights over 150 pounds. There have been multiple layers added to the trophy to continue to feature each winner of the race. </p>
