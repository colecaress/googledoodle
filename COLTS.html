<h2>COLTS</h2>
<p>The Indianapolis Colts, the city’s professional football team, moved to Indianapolis in 1984. At the time, owner Robert Irsay, moved the team in the middle of the night from Baltimore to Indianapolis. In the first few seasons in the Indianapolis, the team struggled with winning games. Even while struggling, they had great attendance to games from fans from Indianapolis. In 1998, the Colts drafted Peyton Manning who brought a whole new era to Colts football. The Colts won the 2006 Super Bowl with Peyton Manning leading the way. This was Indianapolis’ first win in the city. Since the Peyton Manning era, the Colts have seen up and down seasons.
