<h2>BASKETBALL</h2>
<p>Indiana, and the city of Indianapolis has a deep passion for the game of basketball. Ever since the game was founded in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, the game of basketball has been very popular in Indianapolis and in surrounding cities. Indiana hosted the first high school tournament in 1911, and this sparked the beginning of the basketball craze in the state.  The state is home to the biggest high school basketball gyms in the country, and is known to have some of the best atmospheres for games at the college level. When driving through the streets of Indianapolis and around Indiana, you will notice that almost every driveway and barn there is a basketball hoop hanging.
